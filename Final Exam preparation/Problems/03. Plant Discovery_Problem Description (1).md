*You have now returned from your world tour. On your way, you have discovered
some new plants, and you want to gather some information about them and create
an exhibition to see which plant is highest rated.*

On the **first line,** you will receive a number **n**. On the next **n lines**,
you will be given some information about the plants that you have discovered in
the format: **"{plant}\<-\>{rarity}"**. **Store** that **information** because
you will need it later. If you receive a plant **more than once**, **update**
its rarity.

After that, until you receive the **command** **"Exhibition"**, you will be
given some of these **commands**:

-   **"Rate: {plant} - {rating}"** – **add** the given **rating** to the plant
    (**store all ratings**)

-   **"Update: {plant} - {new_rarity}"** – **update** the **rarity** of the
    plant with the **new one**

-   **"Reset: {plant}"** – **remove all** the **ratings** of the given plant

**Note: If any given plant name is invalid, print "error"**

After the command **"Exhibition"**, print the information that you have about
the plants in the following format:

**"Plants for the exhibition:  
\- {plant_name1}; Rarity: {rarity}; Rating: {average_rating}**

**- {plant_name2}; Rarity: {rarity}; Rating: {average_rating}  
…**

**- {plant_nameN}; Rarity: {rarity}; Rating: {average_rating}"**

The **average rating** should be formatted to the **second decimal place.**

### Input / Constraints

-   **You will receive the input as described above**

-   **JavaScript: you will receive a list of strings**

### Output

Write a program that **finds a place for the tourist on a lift.**

Every wagon should have **a maximum of 4 people on it**. If a wagon is full, you
should direct the people to **the next one with space** available.

### Input

-   **On the first line,** you will receive **how many people** are waiting to
    get **on the lift**

-   **On the second line**, you will receive the **current state of the lift
    separated by a single space:** **" "**.

### Output

**When there is no more available space left on the lift**, or there are **no
more people in the queue**, you should print on the console the final state of
the lift's wagons separated by **" "** and one of the following messages:

-   If there are no more people and the lift have empty spots, you should print:

    **"The lift has empty spots!**

    **{wagons separated by ' '}"**

-   If there are still people in the queue and no more available space, you
    should print:

    **"There isn't enough space! {people} people in a queue!**

    **{wagons separated by ' '}"**

-   If the lift is full and there are no more people in the queue, you should
    print only the wagons separated by **" "**

*Merry has a guinea pig named Puppy, that she loves very much. Every month she
goes to the nearest pet store and buys him everything he needs – food, hay, and
cover.*

On the **first three lines**, you will receive **the quantity of food**,
**hay**, and **cover**, which Merry buys for a **month (30 days)**. On the
**fourth line**, you will receive the **guinea pig's weight**.

**Every day** Puppy eats **300 gr of food**. **Every** **second** day Merry
**first feeds the pet**, then gives it a **certain amount of hay** **equal to**
**5%** of the rest of the **food**. On **every** **third** day, Merry puts Puppy
**cover** with **a quantity of** **1/3** of its **weight**.

**Calculate** whether the quantity of **food, hay, and cover**, will be enough
for a **month**.

**If Merry runs out of food, hay, or cover, stop the program!**

## Input

-   **On the first line – quantity food in kilograms** - a floating-point number
    in the range **[0.0 – 10000.0]**

-   **On the second line – quantity hay in kilograms** - a floating-point number
    in the range **[0.0 – 10000.0]**

-   **On the third line – quantity cover in kilograms** - a floating-point
    number in the range **[0.0 – 10000.0]**

-   **On the fourth line – guinea's weight in kilograms** - a floating-point
    number in the range **[0.0 – 10000.0]**

## Output

-   If the food, the hay, and the cover are enough, print:

    -   **"Everything is fine! Puppy is happy! Food: {excessFood}, Hay:
        {excessHay}, Cover: {excessCover}."**

-   If one of the things is not enough, print:

    -   **"Merry must go to the pet store!"**

**The output values must be formatted to the second decimal place!**

| You receive food – **10000**, hay – **5000**, cover – **5200**, weight – **1000** (in grams).  On the first day, Merry gives Puppy 300gr food – 9700gr food left. On the second day, the food left is **9400gr**, so the needed hay is **9400 \* 5%  = 470**, and the hay left is **4530.**  On the third day, the cover left is **4866.67,** and the food left is **9100**, and so on. On the last day, Merry has: food – 1.00, hay – 1.10, and cover – 1.87. |                                                                            |

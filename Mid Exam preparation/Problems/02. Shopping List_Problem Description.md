*It's the end of the week, and it is time for you to go shopping, so you need to
create a shopping list first.*

### Input

You will receive an **initial list** with groceries separated by an exclamation
mark **"!"**.

After that, you will be receiving **4 types** of commands until you receive
**"Go Shopping!"**.

-   **"Urgent {item}"** - **add** the item at the **start** of the list. If the
    item **already exists,** skip this command.

-   **"Unnecessary {item}"** - **remove** the item with the given name, only
    **if it exists** in the list. Otherwise, skip this command.

-   **"Correct {oldItem} {newItem}"** - if the item with the given **old name**
    exists, **change** its name with the **new** one. Otherwise, skip this
    command.

-   **"Rearrange {item}"** - if the grocery exists in the list, **remove** it
    from its **current position** and **add** it at the **end** of the list.
    Otherwise, skip this command.

### Constraints

-   There won't be any duplicate items in the initial list

### Output

-   Print the **list** with all the groceries, joined by **", "**:

    **"{firstGrocery}, {secondGrocery}, â€¦ {nthGrocery}"**

## Class Laptop

Create a **class Laptop** that has the following properties:

-   **info** – object that contains:

-   **producer** – string

-   **age** – number

-   **brand** – string

-   **isOn** – boolean (false by default)

-   **turnOn** – a function that **sets the isOn** variable to **true**

-   **turnOff** – a function that **sets the isOn** variable to **false**

-   **showInfo** – a function that returns the **producer, age, and brand as
    JSON**

-   **quality** – number (every time the laptop **is turned on/off the quality
    decreases by 1**)

-   **getter price** – number (**800 – {age \* 2} + (quality \* 0.5)**)

The **constructor** should receive the **info as an object and the quality.**

### Examples

Test your class.

| **Input**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | **Output**                                               |

| let info = {producer: "Dell", age: 2, brand: "XPS"} let laptop = new Laptop(info, 10) laptop.turnOn() console.log(laptop.showInfo()) laptop.turnOff() console.log(laptop.quality) laptop.turnOn() console.log(laptop.isOn) console.log(laptop.price) |   {"producer":"Dell","age":2,"brand":"XPS"} 8 true 799.5 |
| let info = {producer: "Lenovo", age: 1, brand: "Legion"} let laptop = new Laptop(info, 10) laptop.turnOn() console.log(laptop.showInfo()) laptop.turnOff() laptop.turnOn() laptop.turnOff() console.log(laptop.isOn)                                 | {"producer":"Lenovo","age":1,"brand":"Legion"} false     |

## 2. Flight Schedule

You will receive an **array** with **arrays.**

The first array (**at index 0**) will hold all flights on a **specific**
**sector** in the airport. The second array (**at index 1**) will contain
**newly changed statuses** of **some** of the **flights** at this airport. The
third array (**at index 2**) will have a single **string,** which will **be the
flight status** you need to check. When you put all flights into an **object**
and change the statuses depends on the new information on the second array. You
must print all flights with the given status from the last **array**.

-   If the value of the string obtained from the third array is "**Ready to
    fly**":

-   then you must **print** flights that have **not changed** their **status**
    in the second array

-   and automatically **change** the status to "**Ready to fly**"

-   Otherwise, print **only flights** that have **changed** their status.

## School Register

In this problem, you have to arrange all students by **grade**. You as the
secretary of the school principal will process students and store them into a
school register before the new school year hits. As a draft, you have a list of
all the students from **last year** but mixed. Keep in mind that if a student
has a lower grade than 3, he does not go into the next class. As a result of
your work, you have to print the entire school register **sorted** in
**ascending order by grade** already filled with all the students from last year
in the format:

**\`{nextGrade} Grade**

**List of students: {All students in that grade}**

**Average annual grade from last year: {average annual grade on the entire class
from last year}\`**

And empty row **{console.log}**

The input will be an **array** with strings, each containing a student's name,
last year's grade, and an annual grade. The **average annual grade from last
year** should be **formatted to the second decimal point**.

### Examples

| **Input**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | **Output**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Browser History

As input, you will receive **two parameters**: **an** **object and a string
array.**

The object will be in format: **{Browser Name}:{Name of the browser}, Open
tabs:[…], Recently Closed: […], Browser Logs: […]**. Your task is to fill in the
object based on the actions we will get in the array of strings.

You can **open** any site in the world as many times as you like; if you do that
add it to the open tabs.

You can **close** only these tabs you have **opened already**! If the current
action contains a valid opened site, you should remove it from "**Open Tabs**"
and put it into "**Recently closed**", otherwise **don't do anything!**

**Browser Logs** will hold every single **Valid** action, which you did (Open
and Close).

There is a **special case** in which you can get an action that says: **"Clear
History and Cache".** That means you should **empty the whole object**.

In the end, print the object in the format:

**{Browser name}**

**Open Tabs: {[…]}** // Joined by comma and space

**Recently Closed: {[…]}** // Joined by comma and space

**Browser Logs: {[…]}** // Joined by comma and space

## Sequences

You are tasked with storing sequences of numbers. You will receive an **array of
strings; each of them will contain** an unknown amount of **arrays containing
numbers,** from which you must store only the **unique** arrays (duplicate
arrays should be discarded). An array is considered the **same** (**NOT
unique**) if it contains the **same numbers** as another array**, regardless of
their order**.

After storing all arrays, your program should print them back in **ascending**
order based on their **length**, if two arrays have the same length, they should
be printed in **order of being received from the input**. Each array should be
printed in **descending order** in the format **"[a1, a2, a3,… an]"**. Check the
examples below.

The **input** comes as an **array of strings** where **each entry is a JSON
representing an array of numbers**.

The **output** should be printed on the console - each array printed on a new
line in the format **"[a1, a2, a3,… an]",** following the above-mentioned
ordering.

### Examples

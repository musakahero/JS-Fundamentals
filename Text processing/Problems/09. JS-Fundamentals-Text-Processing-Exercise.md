1.  **Reveal Words**

Write a function, which receives **two parameters**.

The first parameter will be a string with some words **separated by ', '**.

The second parameter will be a string that contains **templates containing
'\*'**.

Find the word with the **same length** as the template and **replace** it.

**Example**

| **Input**                                                                                       | **Output**                                                    |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|

| 'great, learning', 'softuni is \*\*\*\*\* place for \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* new programming languages' | softuni is great place for learning new programming languages |

1.  **Modern Times of \#(HashTag)**

The input will be a **single string.**

**Find all** special words **starting with \#**. If the found special word does
not consist only of letters, then it is invalid and should not be printed.

Finally, print out all the special words you found without the label **(\#)** on
a new line.

**Example**

| **Input**                                                                                           | **Output**               |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| 'Nowadays everyone uses \# to tag a **\#special** word in **\#socialMedia**'                        | special socialMedia      |
| 'The symbol \# is known **\#variously** in English-speaking **\#regions** as the \#**number** sign' | variously regions number |

## Extract File

Write a function that receives a single string - the path to a file (the
'**\\**' character is escaped)

Your task is to subtract the **file name** and its **extension**. (Beware of
files like **template.bak.pptx,** as **template.bak** should be the file name,
while **pptx** is the extension).

### Example

| **Input**                                              | **Output**                               |
|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 'C:\\\\Internal\\\\training-internal\\\\Template.pptx' | File name: Template File extension: pptx |
| 'C:\\\\Projects\\\\Data-Structures\\\\LinkedList.cs'   | File name: LinkedList File extension: cs |

1.  **String Substring**

The input will be given as **two** separated strings (a **word** as a first
parameter and a **text** as a second).

Write a function that checks given text for containing a given word. The
comparison should be **case insensitive.** Once you find a match, **print** the
word and **stop** the program.

If you don't find the word print: **"{word} not found!"**

**Example**

| **Input**                                                   | **Output**        |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| 'javascript', 'JavaScript is the best programming language' | javascript        |
| 'python', 'JavaScript is the best programming language'     | python not found! |

1.  **Replace Repeating Chars**

Write a function that receives a single string and **replace** any sequence of
the **same letters** with a single corresponding letter.

**Examples**

| **Input**                 | **Output** |
|---------------------------|------------|
| 'aaaaabbbbbcdddeeeedssaa' | abcdedsa   |
| 'qqqwerqwecccwd'          | qwerqwecwd |

1.  **Pascal-Case Splitter**

You will receive a **single** **string**.

This string is written in **PascalCase** format. Your task here is to split this
string by **every word** in it.

Print them joined by **comma** and **space.**

**Examples**

| **Input**                            | **Output**                                               |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 'SplitMeIfYouCanHaHaYouCantOrYouCan' | Split, Me, If, You, Can, Ha, Ha, You, Cant, Or, You, Can |
| 'HoldTheDoor'                        | Hold, The, Door                                          |
| 'ThisIsSoAnnoyingToDo'               | This, Is, So, Annoying, To, Do                           |

1.  **Cut and Reverse**

The input will be a **single string.**

Write a function that cuts the given string **into half** and **reverse** the
**two halves.**

Print each half on a **separate line.**

**Examples**

| **Input**                            | **Output**                          |

1.  **\*Hard Words**

You will receive an **array**, which holds the **string** and **another array**.

The string is a letter from a young boy who does not yet know some words and you
have to help him. The letter has a few **holes**, these holes are the words
unknown to the boy and you must fill them with **strings from the array** you
receive at the second index.

If the **length** of the hole is **4** you have to **replace** it with
**string** with the **same length** and so on…

**Examples**

| **Input**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

1.  **\*Password Generator**

For this problem, you have to write a function, which generates a password
depending on input information. As such, you will be given an **array** of
**three strings.** The first two strings will be at least **10 characters
long**, the third one will be **one word.**

Your task here is to concatenate the first two strings and replace all
**vowels** in the **concatenated string** with symbols from the third string.
**The first vowel** must be replaced with the **first character** from the third
string, the **second vowel** with the **second character** from that string, and
so on. If the third string is less than the vowels count in the newly formed
string you need to start over with the **character** on **the 0 index.** When
you replace all vowels **reverse** the new password and print it on the console
in a format:

**'Your generated password is {password}'**

**Note:** All replaced vowels with the characters from the third string must be
upper-case, the rest of the characters are lower-case.

**Examples**

| **Input**                                                         | **Output**                                                            |

**10. \*Letters Change Numbers**

John likes Math. But he also likes the English alphabet a lot. He invented a
game with numbers and letters from the English alphabet. The game is simple. You
get a string consisting of a **number between two letters**. Depending on
whether the letter was in front of the number or after it you would perform
different mathematical operations on the number to achieve the result.

**First,** you start with the letter **before** the number:

-   If it's **uppercase** you **divide** the number by the letter's **position**
    in the alphabet

-   If it's **lowercase** you **multiply** the number with the letter's
    **position** in the alphabet

**Then** you move to the **letter after** the number:

-   If it's **uppercase** you **subtract** its position from the resulted number

-   If it's **lowercase** you **add** its position to the resulted number

But the game became too easy for John is quick. He decided to complicate it a
bit by doing the same but with **multiple** strings keeping track of only the
**total sum** of all results. Once he started to solve this with more strings
and bigger numbers it became quite hard to do it only in his mind. So he kindly
asks you to write a program that calculates the **sum of all numbers after the
operations on each number have been done**.

**For example,** You are given the sequence "**A12b s17G**":

We have two strings - **"A12b"** and **"s17G"**. We do the operations on each
and sum them. We start with the letter before the number on the first string.
**A is Uppercase** and its position in the alphabet is **1**. So we divide the
number 12 with position 1 (**12/1 = 12)**. Then we move to the letter after the
number. **b is lowercase** and its position is 2. So we add 2 to the resulting
number (**12+2=14)**. Similarly for the second string **s is lowercase** and its
position is 19 so we multiply it with the number (**17\*19 = 323)**. Then we
have Uppercase G with position 7, so we subtract it from the resulted number
(**323 - 7 = 316)**. Finally, we sum the 2 results and we get **14 + 316=330**.

**Input**

The input comes as a **text,** holding the **sequence of strings**. Strings are
separated by **one** or **more white spaces**.

The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no
need to check it explicitly.

**Output**

Print on the console a single number: the **total sum of all processed numbers**
rounded up to **two digits** after the decimal separator.

**Constraints**

-   The **count** of the strings will be in the range **[1 … 10].**

-   The numbers between the letters will be integers in the range **[1 … 2 147
    483 647].**

-   Time limit: 0.3 sec. Memory limit: 16 MB.

**Examples**

| **Input**              | **Output** | **Comment**                                             |
|------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| 'A12b s17G'            | 330.00     | 12/1=12, 12+2=14, 17\*19=323, 323-7=316, **14+316=330** |
| 'P34562Z q2576f H456z' | 46015.13   |                                                         |
| 'a1A'                  | 0.00       |                                                         |
